This folder holds Aswath's hands-on experiences in Data Science, Machine Learning, Evolutionary Machine Learning and the concepts that accompany it.

A brief overview of  files in the folder :

Experiment 1: Using a dataset to randomly acquire an equal amount of "p" and "edible" values from the dataset consisting of over 60k attributes. The data is pre-processed and is used to train a simple 1 layer Neural network. A more detailed description is present alongside the code to enhance clarity. 

Experiment 2: In this ML and Evolutionary ML Experiment. We create a neural network which would act as the medium to test our genetic algorithm, The genetic algorithm is one of the most commonly used/generic EML algorithms around. We use it to train the weights of the neural network which classifies our dataset.  

Experiment 3: In this ML and Evolutionary ML Experiment. We create a neural network which would act as the medium to test our Evolutionary strategies algorithm, Evolution strategies is a commonly used EML algorithms along with
the genetic algorithm. We used it to compare the two algorithms and how they differ in training the neural network. Evolutionary Strategies has better accuracy in training them as it is more suited to continuous values.
