This folder holds Aswath's hands-on experiences in Data Science, Machine Learning, Evolutionary Machine Learning and the concepts that accompany it.

A brief overview of  files in the folder :

Experiment 1: Using a dataset to randomly acquire an equal amount of "p" and "edible" values from the dataset consisting of over 60k attributes. The data is pre-processed and is used to train a simple 1 layer Neural network. A more detailed description is present alongside the code to enhance clarity. 

Experiment 2: In this ML and Evolutionary ML Experiment. We create a neural network which would act as the medium to test our genetic algorithm, The genetic algorithm is one of the most commonly used/generic EML algorithms around. We use it to train the weights of the neural network which classifies our dataset.
