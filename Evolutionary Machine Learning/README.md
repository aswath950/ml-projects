# Evolutionary Machine Learning Experiments 

### This folder holds Aswath's hands-on experiences in Evolutionary Machine Learning  and the concepts that accompany it such as Data Science and Machine Learning, etc.

A brief overview of  files in the folder :

[Experiment 1](https://github.com/aswath950/ml-projects/blob/main/Evolutionary%20Machine%20Learning/Experiment-1.jl): Using a dataset to randomly acquire an equal amount of "p" and "edible" values from the dataset consisting of over 60k attributes. The data is pre-processed and is used to train a simple 1 layer Neural network. A more detailed description is present alongside the code to enhance clarity. 

[Experiment 2](https://github.com/aswath950/ml-projects/blob/main/Evolutionary%20Machine%20Learning/Experiment-2.jl): In this ML and Evolutionary ML Experiment. We create a neural network which would act as the medium to test our genetic algorithm, The genetic algorithm is one of the most commonly used/generic EML algorithms around. We use it to train the weights of the neural network which classifies our dataset.  

Experiment 3: In this ML and Evolutionary ML Experiment. We create a neural network which would act as the medium to test our Evolutionary strategies algorithm, Evolution strategies is a commonly used EML algorithms along with
the genetic algorithm. We used it to compare the two algorithms and how they differ in training the neural network. Evolutionary Strategies have better accuracy in training them as it is more suited to continuous values.

Experiment - 4: We use a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to train neural network weights. Like previous experiments, we use the Genetic Algorithm and Backprogation algorithms as a reference to compare the accuracies  of this algorithm. 

Experiment - 5: In this experiment, We compare a 3-layer Neural Network trained with backpropagation vs its weights being trained through a couple of EML algorithms such as  Genetic Algorithms, Evolution Strategies and Particle Swarm Optimization. This experiment is used to understand if multilayer networks are trained although EML algorithms provide better, equal or lesser performance. 

Experiment - 6: In this experiment, we use the package XCS to compare it to backpropagation and other EML algorithms used in past experiments.
