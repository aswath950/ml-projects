# Movie Recommender System using ML Algorithms

### The recommender system uses Cosine similarity to find the closest matching movies based on the inputs the user provides. Prior to implementing the algorithms, We preprocess multiple data sets to bring them to the standard at which algorithms can be readily applied on the data.
