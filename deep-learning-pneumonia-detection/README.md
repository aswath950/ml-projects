# Deep Learning model to predict Pneumonia in Infants

#### The [Pneumonia-Detection-Model.ipynb](deep-learning-pneumonia-detection/Pneumonia-Detection-Model.ipynb) file contains the source code which declares trains and validates a CNN model. This model acts as a binary classifier which classifies if infants have pneumonia or not, based on their chest X-rays. This model has an accuracy above 90 per cent.
